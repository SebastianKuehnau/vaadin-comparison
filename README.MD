# Vaadin Comparison

Vaadin comparison is a project to show the different implementation types of Vaadin on a simple example. For this purpose, classic use cases in Vaadin 8, Vaadin Flow and Vaadin Fusion are implemented in parallel and can be compared directly. The several use cases are split in the following branches:

1. [Simple Grid](https://github.com/SebastianKuehnau/vaadin-comparison/tree/simple-grid)
2. [Grid with Lazy loading](https://github.com/SebastianKuehnau/vaadin-comparison/tree/lazy-grid)
3. [Simple Grid with Filter](https://github.com/SebastianKuehnau/vaadin-comparison/tree/filter-simple-grid)
4. [Grid with Filter and Lazy Loading](https://github.com/SebastianKuehnau/vaadin-comparison/tree/filter-lazy-grid)
